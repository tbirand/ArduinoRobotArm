Arduino Robot Arm v0.1a
=======================

The project is organized into three folders:

* Arduino - This folder holds the Arduino source code driving the robot arm with vectors received on the serial port.
* Desktop - Contains source code for a reference desktop app developed with the Qt framework.
* Design - This folder has the OpenSCAD design file of the robot arm parts for 3d printing.

The design for this robot arm is based on the 3d printed parts by holgero at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:65081 with a few tweaks of mine.
